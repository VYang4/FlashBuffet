# My Java Project

## Proposal
Food wastage has always been a challenging problem in the food industry. 
On the one hand, it is costly for businesses to transport and dispose leftovers. 
On the other hand, food waste leads to greenhouse gas emissions, which is a major contributor to climate change. 
Therefore, I plan to build an application to help fight food waste. 
This application allows restaurants/hotels to sell unsold food and surplus buffet to customers at a largely reduced price. 
It lets the merchants enter information about their offerings. 
Possible features include showing the customers the locations, the time, the prices, and the food varieties.
